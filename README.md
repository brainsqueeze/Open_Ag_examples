# Open Ag ML examples

Setup
=====

This notebook contains some machine learning and data manipulation and transformation examples.
It is written for python 2.7.x (can be adapted for 3.5.x if that is what you are working with).  You 
will need to install:

	1. Jupyter
	2. NumPy
	3. Matplotlib
	4. Scikit-learn

You can pip install them individually (or run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them all in one go). Alternatively, downloading [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) will enable to you to obtain all the relevant scientific computing
libraries packaged together.

To start the notebook, navigate to the folder containing the notebook and run

	> jupyter notebook

This will open the folder in a browser, and you can open the notebook from there.
